The iPhone 7 is definitely worth the upgrade The world isnt ready for it Get the hell out of here lol The Verge Also poo pooing the most important and least talked about component of why Apples hardware is always a step ahead  engineering The meshing of hardware and software Every year the iPhones camera consistently beats out other smartphones in blind tests Except for camera specific feature phones etc No one else can duplicate what Apple does Thats a tough pill for many to swallow And that doesnt mean that there arent GREAT competitors either,neutral,Tech,neutral

Youre pretty much saying that you think its too advanced for this gen but its not If Apple wanted to throw all they have and put all their efforts into a phone then yes it would but theyre not doing that Theyre releasing already improved upon technology little by little just so suckers that feel a need to upgrade to the new iPhone because they think theyre cool throw more money at them Its a greedy company that has a lot more to offer than its letting on and its disappointing that they dont go all out,neutral,Tech,neutral

As a concept I like it But the execution is poor an example of a company so focused on cool that basic structural engineering problems are ignored For instance the flat roof flat roofs are great if they arent actually flat you need some gradient on the roof so that water doesnt stagnate Now look at 305 the roof has stagnating water on it because the roof wasnt designed with a gradient or at least not one sufficient for drainage The person living in the house will eventually end up with a leaking roof Architects and engineers are helpful for thinking of and solving these issues the Kasita team doesnt seem to have many of them Again I like the concept of small efficient living spaces but Im not putting my money into something like this until their team realizes the product has to be a good product not just a cool one,neutral,Tech,neutral

sony xz1 4k is the best phone display ever made even beating samsungs oled because even when it is set for 1080P in down scales so well text and everything is super sharp much better than the 1080P and 750P lcds on the iPhone or samsung oled But the thing is most youtube reviewers never have them side by side and it is a battery drainer of course at 4K and bezels  I like your honest review looks like so far the note 8 lg v30 Mate 10 and upcoming U11 plus are the great flagships this year Maybe next year Apple will have all of the bugs ironed out And settle with qualcomm so we can get the best bluetooth hires audio codecs for the next wireless airpods and beats as the current ones have none and some of the fastest cell phone downloads with qualcomm lte 5 gigabit,positive,Tech,positive

it is surprising to me that not many people know that this is a new processor and probably consumes less power Samsung knows what they are doing they know that this phone is critical samsung didnt reduce the size of the battery capacity entirely because of the note 7 what happened with the note 7 was manufacturing problems with the battery etc samsung even changed the chemicals used in the battery so it has a longer lifespan optimization can give a battery with not that giant capacity the ability to last for the same amount of time and the same amount of time over usage samsung obviously thought of this they wont pull an Apple on us that would be suicide,neutral,Tech,neutral

I just ordered a black and white 2XL Ive used iPhones exclusively since the 3GS and always found it very limited in many ways Dont get me wrong Im definitely a fan of iOS and iPhones in general but Im excited to step out of that ecosystem and see what pure android has to offer A bit of offaxis blue shifting is definitely not a big enough issue to avoid the Pixel in my opinion There are so many more Ws in its column than there are Ls and if Im going to sink my teeth into android I want to experience it in its best form and be the first to receive updates when it inevitably gets better I considered getting an S8S8 for a bit but after seeing how well tuned Googles software experience is along with a few other things I liked much more about the Pixel 2XL it really wasnt a competition in my mind,neutral,Tech,neutral

Who is here after the giveaway announcement,neutral,Tech,neutral
Im surprised many people in the comments dont like this design because this model is actually my favorite one to date To be fair the white color doesnt do it justice I think judging by the glossy material that this phone will look much better in black The glass back and the chrome edges look more classier The larger screen to phone size ratio is much more practical than buying a larger phone for a larger screen with bulkier edges The only thing I didnt like with this model is how the white edging on the front facing cameras is awkwardly placed They should have just extended the edges instead of keeping the corners bare Its not like the corners are going to be actively used or even touched so the design doesnt feel effective It will also distract users when playing games or watching movies I dont even know how notifications will be placed when the edge stands in the way I feel like the majority will purchase this model in black so the awkward top edges are less visible with the black screen when turned off,neutral,Tech,neutral

OnePlus is owned by BBK Electronics BBK has 9000 employees and OnePlus makes up less than 1000 of those employees To put that into perspective Samsung has 325000 employees BBK Electronics is also made up of 3 different phone brands OnePlus Oppo and Vivo while Samsung only has one They are a small company in an industry run by giants EDIT Im aware Samsung has other revenue streams all this means is they have more money to spend on RD You cannot expect Samsunglike features on BBK phones because they dont have the disposable income to develop such features,neutral,Tech,neutral

If Apple actually removes the 35mm headphone jack in lieu of the Lightning port then count me out The 30 pin connector was understandable but the 35mm jack is ubiquitous and is far from being obsolete Im not entirely against phasing out the 35 mm jack but it shouldnt be just to make the iPhone thinner especially without focusing on improving battery life which is a bigger issue considering battery tech has stagnated and it shouldnt be with Lightning USB Type C is going to be the universal standard and it would make far more sense Apple has even used USB Type C in the new MacBook and is a fan of the IO Lightning is a limited proprietary connector with known durability issues that hasnt even taken hold among thirdparty battery cases designed for the iPhone its still all Micro USB excluding Apples own battery case,neutral,Tech,neutral

Yeah Apple have removed stuff before but this is the AUDIO JACK Its not the same as other standards Sure Apply removed the floppy drive but that was because CDs were simply better and they removed the CD drive but that was because digital downloads are simply better 30pin connecter was too simply inferior to the Lightning cable Theres no better solution for audio What bluetooth There arent enough of them around and theyre ridiculously expensive And using the lightning port brings up the new MacBooks 1 USBC problem its not practical Apple has only ever removed things when there was an alternative that was superior in pretty much every way in order to speed up the adoption of the better format There isnt a better format for audio jacks,neutral,Tech,neutral

Im sorry but all the possible benefits you mentioned from using headphones through the lightning port are all possible with the 35mm jack My phone has digital noise cancellation build in and the phone recognizes when you plug in a certain type of headphonesearplugs and you can setup what you want to happen when you do plug them in open a music app change the volume turn the noise cancelling on or off etc The number 1 reason why Apple would want to get rid off the 35mm jack and use the lightning port is very simple money and market share 3 times guess who makes headphones with lightning cables Yes Beats which is owned by Apple They are not the only ones to make them and there are much better brands out there but they make them They just want to promote and sell more Beats headphones slap another 50 bucks onto the price and say that they are designed for iPhones Nothing points to the fact that Apple would do it to save space If space for lets say a bigger battery would be such an issue why are they making their phones thinner all the time The idea you mentioned at the end of what your perfect new iPhone would be is what I think the majority of phonetech enthousiast want Sadly 90 of people buying iPhones are far from tech savvy and mostly only buy it because of the name,neutral,Tech,neutral

I have always loved to buy the Samsung Galaxy S phones and one of the main attractions was not just the removable battery but also the option of additional storage via SD card slot I dont know why the reviewers always seem to make a fuss about the plastic feel of the phone it never bothered me in fact I prefer it because it made the phone stand out in a positive way in my mind because you could remove and load up a fresh battery to get you through the day Why some people think that the Galaxy phone is trying to look like the iPhone is a bit of mystery to me but if that is what Samsung was aiming for I would certainly be disappointed because as far as Im concerned the iPhone has more hype and the Samsung more value for money but both devices are equal in terms of performance and usability its just a matter of choice So in short I would have already purchased an S6 or S6 Edge buy now but Im holding off because of my concerns about battery life and the lack of external storage Im seriously thinking of going for one of the Chinese phones eg Meizu that may not have the desired options of battery and storage but are a lot cheaper with excellent performance,neutral,Tech,positive

I am writing this from a iPhone 10 after a week of use as my daily driver So Im coming off the google pixel for the last year And before that I was iPhone 3g4 5 5s and 6 I hate how you big reviewers dont flat out call out apple and other companies when they are on bull shit The pixel had the pip for YouTube where I can keep the video going while doing other things on the phone They didnt put the usb c on this phone for but its on the iPad and MacBooks Wtf u have to pay 90 to get apple rapid charging cables and box Who gives a fuck about the notches Its 1000 and doesnt come with AirPods but the galaxy 10 is coming with free buds on pre order They still havent dropped the apple air power wireless charging and google pixel 3 has the charging stand for 70 and I bet air power will be upwards of 150 Yall always talk about screen time right out the box brand new But we all know screen time matters after a year of use and going through the software upgrades and then noticing your battery life is shit all of a sudden after that new software upgrade So fuck screen time right out the box we all know its gonna be good And yall never call out this company for implementing things in their phones that have already been done by Samsung and others And then apple passes these old features off as new and innovative Most of you big reviewers are getting free stuff from the companies so yall wont keep it real and 100 And the god damn air pods dont have wireless charging that Im sure they could have easily added but wanted to keep people in the market for the AirPods 2 and charge 200 No volume control on the air pods either All this is shit that should be on this phone for 1000 Yall never speak on this shit But like I said yall dont want to stop getting invited to the press releases and getting the free stuff and the fame that comes with being a big tech reviewer Cause if Yall didnt care you guys would call out bullshit The phone isnt that bad but for 1000 it could have been a lot better,neutral,Tech,neutral

To those who are thinking of getting an Iphone SE let me tell you you will not be disappointed I just bought one and its awesome It works really well software is amazing the built quality feels very premium The battery life is very very good If your not a major gamer and you use the phone for business purposes your phone can last you over a day I used to own a midrange phone the ASUS Zenfone 6 with a 3300 mah battery and I can tell you for a fact that the Iphone SE battery lasts much longer Its really all depends on how efficient the entire system is and because the Iphone is very efficient Apple doesnt need to stuff a large battery for the phone to last a day I have seen some reviews wherein the Iphone SE battery lasts longer than the S7 The camera quality is great both for front and back Dont get confused by the over super detailed comparison between the photo quality of the Iphone SE to other other phones In real life usage you wont even see any difference The only thing I can see why this phone will discourage some people is because of the screen size Thats all everything else works so well Games work smoothly even the high graphic games work smoothly Despite the screen being small it really doesnt affect game play Even typing is not difficulty My old phone was 6 inches and I shifted to 4 inches and I dont regret one bit The price of this phone is similar to the Samsung Aseries and believe me the Iphone SE feels more premium and works more fluid I used to only have Android Phones and the Iphone SE is my first Iphone and I know realize how big the difference is between Iphone and the rest of the pack ,neutral,Tech,neutral

The fingerprint sensor is literally the perfect position for me I have small hands but Ive always held the phone around the middle not the bottom like it seems you do so my finger doesnt have to stretch to reach the sensor Feels like a very natural position and placement to me Holding the phone any lower down makes it feel top heavy anyway So yeah fingerprint sensor is in the perfect place in my opinion,positive,Tech,neutral

I find your impression about the fingerprint reader positioning very strange I just received my Galaxy S8 yesterday When I hold it in my notsobig hand in a normal way the fingerprint reader is right under the tip of my index finger Actually it would be so awkward if it was in the center and lower Some people say you may put your finger over the camera and make it dirty thats invalid too 1 Dont forget about muscle memory it will become second nature in a week 2 Cellphone lenses are already dirty in comparison to what we expect from a camera because they dont have protection and are exposed to direct touch so they should be cleaned before shooting serious photos regardless of what the phone is 3 I think cellphone cases which many people use will help us distinguishing fingerprint reader a little bit better andor protecting the lens from being touch I think the only valid complain would be from lefthanded users And finally dont forget it has iris scanner,neutral,Tech,neutral

Galaxy S7 ELECTROCUTED ME I bought my device in April 2016 and it had already gone for repair twice to the service centre This is the 3rd time I have faced an issue with the charging port on the phone as it ELECTROCUTED me I am not even exaggerating it literally shocked me while it was in my right front pocket The intensity was so high that I jumped and screamed in pain After multiple requests Samsung has shamelessly denied to replace my device I had just returned from work on my motorcycle 5 mins before the incident I COULD HAVE DIED if this would have happened while I was riding on the highway and no one would have known why I crashed I had a lot of trust in Samsung but how their service team has behaved with me is beyond shameful The service manager on the phone even told me that compensation would have been provided if something bad had happened I was baffled by such a remark because it shows how much they care about their consumers Samsung Note 7 the grenade wasnt enough that they created Galaxy S7 the tazer Dont be a fool like me DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG devices if you want to be safe Regards Kushal Kaushik This is a genuine case write to me is you have any suggentions on how I should deal with Samsung  SocialJunkiee,neutral,Tech,neutral

Bixby is the future The secret to Bixby is the system actually writes its own code In contrast to any other similar system It is a profound and monumental giant leap forward Dynamically Evolving Cognitive Architecture The structure of the Voice First world is held together by Intelligent Agents Intelligent Agents use AI Artificial Intelligence and ML Machine Learning to decode volition and intent from an analyzed phrase or sentence The AI in most current generation systems like Siri Echo and Cortana focuses on speaker independent word recognition and to some extent the intent of predefined words or phrases that have a hard coded connection to a domain expertise Bixby uses a patented 1 exponential self learning system as opposed to the linear programed systems currently used by systems like Siri Echo and Cortana What this means is that the technology in use by Bixby is orders of magnitude more powerful because Bixbys operational software requires just a few lines of seed code to establish the domain 2 ontology 3 and taxonomy 4 to operate on a word or phrase In the old paradigm each task or skill in Siri Echo and Cortana needed to be hard coded by the developer and siloed in to itself with little connection to the entire custom lexicon of domains custom programmed This means that these systems are limited to how fast and how large they can scale Ultimately each silo can contact though related ontologies and taxonomies but it is highly inefficient At some point the lexicon of words and phrases will become a very large task to maintain and update Bixby solves this rather large problem with simplicity for both the system and the developer Specimen of the developer console identifying domain intent programing Bixbys team calls this new paradigm the Dynamically evolving cognitive architecture system There is limited public information on the system and I can not address any private information I may have access to However the patent Dynamically evolving cognitive architecture system based on thirdparty developers 5 published on December 24th 2014 offers an incredible insight on the future Bixby Has Built An Easy Way For Developers To Build This Bixby patent is a landmark advance for Intelligent Agents and the resulting Voice First devices and uses case that will be developed on the platform The process for adding new domain experience is a simple process in the developer app To define a new intent the domain is established by programing a horizontal flow chart that helps to define ontology and taxonomy with in the entire system The results are lines of code that will forever be dynamically changing and connecting as more domains of intent are established Bixby literally programs itself This is process is related to self modifying code that has been around since the 1960s from assembly language to Cobol However the process that Bixby uses is radically more advanced The limitations we have all come to know with Siri Echo and Cortana and the Chat Bots released with Facebook M are tied to the limitations of extending new intent domains and connecting new ontologies and taxonomies Not only does each intent domain need to be programed from decoding a word or phrase but these silos of intents need to some how connect when more complex sentences are created For example SiriAlexa I want to pick up a Pizza on the way to my girl friends house and I would like to find a perfect wine to pick up along the way Also would like to bring her flowers Currently Siri and Alexa could not understand the intent of this paragraph nor could it easy connect to the six domains and many ontologies to produce a useful result Bixby could learn this in a few minutes and constantly connect with new intent domains by expanding the ontological references each domain represents Another feature of Bixby will be the user profile that defines Conversational intentUnderstands What You Say Location context Time context Task context Dialog context Understands You Learns and acts on personal information Who are your friends Where do you live What is your age What do you like You will set privacy fences around any information that Bixby learns and you will be able to choose to allow the system to share this data with any intent domain Of course security and privacy will always be an issue with Intelligent Agents and Bixby is working on a new model that will quickly define what is logically private and potentially shareable with permissions,neutral,Tech,neutral

I really dont understand why the front is not black,neutral,Tech,neutral
MKBHD i would just like to say that I will stop watching and everything else to reviewers that gets EARLY ACCESS to manufacturers device Because this EARLY ACCESS is in a way a form of payment to you Which leads to bias It leads to video formats that is less critical to the product For example instead of making a bend drop test or comparison review of the early access device you tend to go with a safer format video where you talk about iphone features you didnt know about  At the end of the day no manufacturer will let you have early access and them not benefitting from it I can see that you still have little criticisms however I can tell that its more for making the overall early access video legitimacy because it will sound like you are kissing their backside The gist of it is early access comes at a price and thats making a video thats balancing the benefits of maintaining that relationship with the manufacturers while at the same time critiquing but in a way thats not making it sound like this device is so lame Or sticking to a video format thats overall safe like the example I gave earlier So i will avoid viewing videos from youtubers that get early access Il only watch video reviews from reviewers that are not clouded by viewerships And focus on the critiquing side coz those benefits the consumers You should make a video of the in and outs  all details of how early access works for you And how you play with the balance of reviewing and not hurting the manufacturers that gives you early access Viewers need to know,neutral,Tech,neutral

Why would you want to see your leftright indicator control lights anyway I think we can do without Its good that tesla throws conventions out the window But indeed it is important to optimize the design to the user So perhaps it would be better if some vital data is projected in front of the driver eg on the windscreen or the dash like speed And fine tune some of the controls wrt ease of use vs simplicity I mean moving everything to software is an interesting development opening up new possibilities and is probably cheaper in production  but it should not get in the way of the ease of use What if there is sn emergency and you need to get something from your glove compartment in a splitvsecond under a lot of stress You dont want to be forced to navigate through some computer screens then So as always a design must be clever  thinking of all use cases,neutral,Tech,positive

To those of you that claim this isnt smosh allow me to explain 1 smosh is a group founded by Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla as time went on they branched off into smosh games smosh cartoons and have also begun working with different people such as Mari Olivia Joven sohinki and wes these are all now members of smosh and thus all content made by them is smosh content 2 for those of you who say in the beginning it was only Ian and Anthony you are far from correct as in countless videos from the Pokemon videos the assassins creed rap to even the first food battle they had extras camera crew and side characters such as Ians mom Stevie and so on and the every blank ever videos are most likely heavily produced and directed by the founders just because the founders arent in EVERY video they make doesnt mean it isnt their content when was the last time you even heard the name Fusajiro Yamauchi for those who dont know Fusajiro Yamauchi is the founder of Nintendo and yet modern games such as smash bros 4 Pokemon x and y and hyrule warriors dont seem to have his face plastered everywhere i guess it isnt his content then i think you see my point,neutral,Comedy,neutral

Watch the interview when Burke was a child he is asked how he thinks she died He says maybe with a hammer and he swings his arm like hes hitting someone on the head Interesting Because this was before the autopsy results that confirmed she did indeed suffer blunt force trauma to the skull from an object Also I think Dr Phil should have confronted him on Patsys 911 call it was clear 2 other people were speaking in the background one a child and another adult male The whole I dunno nothin approach is pretty unbelievable His fingerprints were on the bowl of pineapple She ate the pineapple right before her death Screaming was heard from the house around 1am All the background voices on the 911 call Someone in that house knew something,neutral,News,neutral
If Burke did it I just hope one day he confessed what he did Poor girl she deserves peace and rest Its been a long time,neutral,News,neutral

Why is this guy smiling the whole time That kinda freaks me out,neutral,News,neutral
I would wager my life Burke did it The parents were able to go on tv and honestly deny killing her because they didnt Also if one of the parents killed her they would not be covering for and supporting eachother The 911 call is the nail in the coffin You can hear Patsy asking someone what theyve done and the son responding something about getting arrested People need to understand the parents did whatever they could to not lose their only remaining child Most people would of done something similar If you compare Patsys hand writing sample to the ransom note you see its a 999 percent chance she wrote it If thats true she was covering for someone and that someone wouldnt be her husband She wouldnt protect that man after he murders her daughter The son however is a different story,neutral,News,neutral
I really truly believe that they all the three of them know exactly what happened to jonbenet,neutral,News,neutral
he murdered her  burke said he thought someone bashed her over the head BEFORE autopsy results came in he literally mimicked the way he murdered her  burke taking 5 minutes to identify pineapple in crime scene during interview acting very nervous and suspicious  his and his moms fingerprints on pineapple bowl  mom lied she didnt feed them pineapple  pineapple in bowl found at crime scene  pineapple found inside jon benet plus theres more evidence other than the pineapple but that was the big one for me,neutral,News,neutral

Detectives found a partial draft of the ransom note in the home and the legal pad on which the final ransom had been written on three of seven pages torn from the center of the padAnd although it may seem too obvious even to point out realize that unlike in the JonBenet Ramsey murder  a kidnapper doesnt write the ransom note in the house  a kidnapper doesnt write that herespectshis victims business  a kidnapper doesnt molest the victim in the house  a kidnapper doesnt kill the victim in the house  a kidnapper doesnt hang out writingand rewriting after the victim is dead  a kidnapper doesnt leave the victim behind in the house  a kidnapper doesnt forget to call to arrange to get the ransom money  a kidnapper doesnt break in on Christmas risking family stay overs  a kidnapper doesnt put oversized underwear found in the house on the victim  a kidnapper doesnt bring someone to the crime 3rd persons DNAon a stain and  a kidnapper certainly doesnt do ALL of the above A predator likewisedoesnt break in to molest a child inside her home and he sure doesnt stop to write a ransom note And if it helps to think through these observations replace the word kidnapper above with intruder,neutral,News,neutral

Trace or touch DNA can be found on brand new clothes from the people who make or ship it It is erroneous to clear or charge anyone based on it JonBenet ate pineapples the night she died it was found in her small intestine There was a bowl of pineapples with Patsy and Burkes finger prints on it at the scene but not JonBenets Burke was clearly eating pineapples that night which contradicts their testimony that he was in his bedroom the whole night There also was a large flashlight in the kitchen that if used as a weapon is consistent with the head trauma she suffered The marks on her neck are consistent with being poked by Burkes model train set tracks perhaps to try to wake her up Burke had anger issues he had hit JonBenet previously with a golf club in the face He also pooped in her bed and on her Christmas presents that night When a psychologist interviews Burke and shows him a photo of the bowl of pineapples Burke gets very fidgety and cannot identify what it is he acts as though he does not know what a bowl of pineapple is even though in the same interview he earlier said pineapples was one of his favorite fruits So we know JonBenet ate one of his pineapples likely grabbing it out of the bowl and that he had hit her before How would a kid with anger issues react to his little sister stealing his favorite fruit It appears Burke accidentally killed his little sister and then the parents staged it to look like a foreign faction did it It explains all the inconsistencies like why she was both struck dead and tied up and choked and sexually abused they wanted to make it look like a violent intruder or the extremely long and confusing note which includes multiple paraphrased movie quotes The basement of their house had movie posters hanging in it Patsy was ambidextrous and her handwriting was tested for her dominant hand but she easily could have used her other hand to make it look different Additionally John Ramsey said he had broke the glass in the window some weeks earlier and used it to get in the house when he had locked himself out it wasnt broken that night In the 911 call the muddled audio at the end can now be heard of the three of them talking in the kitchen before the call hangs up It appears to include John saying we are not talking to you  John and Patsy are not talking to Burke Then Patsy saying what did you do Help me Jesus asking Burke what he did Then a young boys voice clearly Burke saying what did you find This contradicts the familys testimony that Burke was in his room the whole night The parents had discovered that their older child struck and killed their younger child and in a panic decided to make it look like he hadnt done it to not lose both their children in a single night Lastly in 2013 a judge unsealed some grand jury documents related to the investigation Despite the District Attorney deciding to not bring charges it shows that the grand jury had voted to bring charges against the parents but not for murder The grand jury saw all the evidence and voted to indict John and Patsy on two counts endangering JonBenet and being accessories to a murderhiding evidence This is completely consistent with the grand jury charging the parents for allowing JonBenet to be near Burke who was a very troubled kid and for covering it up Yet the politicized DA who was friends with the Ramseys did nothing Theres little mystery left in this caseIn fact there is proof beyond reasonable doubt,neutral,News,neutral
After watching his interviews back when he was still around 10 or 11 I believe he is the one who killed his sister Maybe its not in his intention to kill but he is still the person responsible for what happened to the poor girl The family is very famous and their image of a happy family is something that they must protect at all cost so thats why the parents covered up for him The reason why he is not remorseful is because I bet his parents keep on telling him that its not his fault and that it was an accident but he must not tell the truth because he didnt mean to hurt his sister Burke is jealous of his sister One of their neighbors told the investigators that Burke once hit his sister on the face and that Burke never really played with other children in the neighborhood esp when JanBenett is around,neutral,News,neutral

This is Just Sad  You can tell when someone is Guilty or have been up to no good They Cant look you in the Eye or are really Awkward to be around  And if the Ramseys did do it I ask how could you hit your own child or stage that someone broke into the house   For the Sake of God if You Loved your child like they Claim they Did then why did they if proven guilty kill her Its Soo Wrong  I believe Burke was jealous but I Do believe He Loved her I feel like her Father put her on a pedistool and Burke couldnt cope with it and So Patsy saw this and Completely Pampered him  And tried making him number one or Noticeable ,neutral,News,neutral
To be honest from day one I always felt like he did it It just best fits the evidence and parents behavior after I think it was sibling abuse that was going on awhile due to jealousy and that night it went too far The parents had to save the kid they had left So they staged the ligature and note She went willingly down there with whoever it was,neutral,News,neutral

I think Burke killed JonBenet Burke woke up hungry he went downstairs to get pineapple and milk JonBenet then woke up probably to use the bathroom or she woke up because she Peed on herself She saw a light on downstairs went downstairs to see what was going on She then saw her brother in the kitchen eating pineapple Then she went over grabbed it with her fingers and ate a piece Burke then got mad at JonBenet for eating his pineapple JonBenet then ran downstairs to the basement Burke went chasing after her grabbed the flashlight from the kitchen and ran downstairs Burke soon caught up with JonBenet then hit her with the flashlight on her head Burke then realized what he had done He then grabbed JonBenet and dragged her to the other room He then ran back upstairs went back in his room and pretended to fall asleep Patsy and her husband both woke up to the noise and checked the house and the rooms They both saw Burke in his bed sleeping and went to check JonBenets room and found her missing so they went to check around the house for her They then went down to the basement and checked the rooms and then found JonBenets body on the ground Patsy then screamed and Bourke got out of his bed and ran to the basement Then thats when they had their conversation what did you do Patsy were not talking to you John oh Jesus oh Jesus Patsy what did you findBurke Burke thought he was slick trying to play it off When he probably killed his sister Then the parents wanted to cover it up by strangling her even though she was already dead or slowly dying Or Burke could have done all of that to her then went upstairs I dont know I just want this solved Its very sad its taking over 20 years to solve this case,neutral,News,neutral

*A COMMON MISCONCEPTION is that evolution should lead to some particular trait* such as a large brain There is no goal to evolution not speed not strength not intelligence and certainly not humanity Evolution is about one thing survival Evolution occurs at the molecular level Mutations occur with every cell division and replication in every living species Those mutations are the raw material for the genetic variation we see in every population of organisms It is the then current environment which wields the pruning shears favoring those mutations that best suit the organism for that environment Apes that stayed in the forest became todays chimps bonobos orangs and gorillas They are very well suited for their environments One that opted for the savanna faced different evolutionary pressures that set it on a different evolutionary trajectory The modern human brain is about 2 of total body mass yet is requires fully 20 of total caloric consumption I think you can understand that for most animals it is a daily challenge to consume enough calories just to survive and a larger brain would be more of a burden than an asset It is also the case that the larger human brain requires that babies be born at a less advanced stage of neural development placing an additional burden primarily on the mother Japanese researchers have compared brain scans of baby macaques chimps and human children and found that brain volume for both chimp and human babies increase at three times the rate of infant macaques however during early childhood human brain expansion was twice that of chimpanzees due to rapid growth of connections between brain cells In the human infant fully 60 of caloric intake go into neuronal development For just about any other species the necessity for such a long childhood would place them at a survival disadvantage We are just now beginning to understand the environmental pressures that lead to a larger brain increasingly complex social networks the development of language that enabled a culture built around tool manufacture and use and cooperative hunting no doubt played a role The challenges of a rapidly changing climate may also have been a contributing factor But if it had not been for the development of language humanity would have had to continuously reinvent the Acheulian Hand Axe Two factors allowing human speech are the hyoid bone also present in Neanderthals to which the muscles of the tongue are attached and a particular variant of the FOXP2 gene found in other mammals that allows for complex speech Humans share this variant with both Neanderthal and Denisovans indicating that it was inherited from a common ancestor Neither chimps bonobos or other apes have that variation indicating that it arose sometime after the species diverged So yes the human evolutionary history is indeed complex but as Richard Feinman said Science is the joy of finding things out We are getting a lot of clues as to the expansion of the human brain from embryology and comparative genomics but we see a progression in brain size from early mammals to primates to monkeys to apes and to humans It may be of interest to you to know that while most mammal brains are smooth primate brains have convolutions which increase the surface area of the cortex we see increased convolutions from monkeys to apes and more in humans See Molecular evolution of FOXP2 a gene involved in speech and language Wolfgang Enard Molly Przeworski Simon E Fisher Cecilia S L Lai Victor Wiebe Takashi Kitano Anthony P Monaco Svante Pbo Nature 418 869  872 22 Aug 2002 httpwwwnaturecomnaturejournalv418n6900fullnature01025html,neutral,News,neutral

*HOW EVOLUTION WORKS* It is helpful to understand that evolution is a molecular process The random mutations that naturally occur during cell division and replication mitosis and meiosis are the raw material for the genetic variation we see in every population of organisms Mutations are ongoing and continuous for every living species Those mutations are subjected to a selection process that is performed by whatever environment the organisms find themselves In this respect evolution is an ongoing continuous set of experiments Those that work get perpetuated those that dont perish It is as if the environment acted as an umpire who says There are good mutations and there are bad mutations and there are neutral mutations but they aint nuthin until I the environment calls em That is Natural Selection Neutral mutations just go along for the ride without producing immediate benefit Genetic Drift The result of those selection processes is organisms best suited for their current environment Should that environment change it would put the population under stress If the population gene pool has sufficient genetic variation it increases the likelihood that at least some offspring should be able to survive and perpetuate the species albeit one of slightly different genetic makeup What you should understand is that genetic changes do not occur because of some need The mutations are RANDOM and get selected if they are USEFUL That is a process and it is anything BUT random Lets take the example of the Panda Bears in general are omnivores eating plant matter but with a marked preference for meat when available The preferred food of the Panda however is bamboo leaves which have such low nutritional value that they must eat almost continuously The Panda would certainly be able to extract more nutrition with a four chambered stomach as in ungulates and whales or something akin to a cecal valve but it has neither in its genetic toolbox In feeding themselves pandas are continuously stripping bamboo leaves from their stalks a process that could be facilitated if they had a thumb Bears however do not have thumbs nor do they have genes for them in their genetic toolbox Nor do new features simply spring into existence However if a slightly altered body component provides some benefit natural selection will perpetuate it Evolution results in incremental alterations to what is already there As an analogy imagine a robot gardener dragging a hose around various obstacles it encounters in a garden until it can go no further Now an intelligent gardener could simply retrace his steps and take a different path avoiding those obstacles The robot gardener evolution is not an intelligent force and cannot do that With a limited tool kit it can only figuratively add more hose to get the job done While a thumb would be quite useful to a panda for stripping leaves evolution cannot rewind to produce one Instead it has taken a piece of hose a wrist bone and enlarged it to act as a stand in for a thumb That is not an elegant solution and not a perfect one but it gets the job done Evolution is does not produce perfect solutions but tweaks here and there to get the job done THAT is how evolution operates Based in part on the fact that no tetrapods terrestrial vertebrates exist in the fossil record prior to about 370 million years ago the Theory of Evolution would predict that tetrpods evolved from fish If that were the case there should have existed at one time a fish with characteristics of both fish and tetrapods In other words a Transitional Species Until about 2005 there was little evidence for such a creature There were however a class of fish called Sarcopterygians or Lobe Finned Fishes that dominated Devonian seas What charracterized those lobe finned fishes was that those fins were supported by external bones and muscles Those bones a single bone connected to two bones conncted to smaller bones are analogous to the limb bones of all tetrapods including humans Most Sarcopterygian Fishes have long been extinct but they are survied today by two species of coelacnth and six species of lungfish Still what was missing was a fossil showing characteristics of fish AND tetrapods When Neil Shubin and his team decided to search for a fossil that filled the gap between the Lobe Finned Fishes that dominated Devonian Seas and the earliest tetrapod fossils represented by Ichtheostega and Acanthostega dated about 370 mya Since those fossils were found in geologic deposits indicating a freshwater environment and if the Theory of Evolution is correct in its hypothesis that tetrapods evolved from fish then transitional fossils should be found in similar deposits somewhat older in age The problem was that geologic deposits of that age are exposed at few places on the earths surface Fortunately a great deal of geologic exploration has been done throughout the world financed often times by oil and mining interests They selected an area in the Canadian Arctic Ellesmere Island as having the greatest likelihood of success It took 4 years of searching during the short summers of that hostile environment but succeeded returning in 2004 with 9 specimens of the fish they named Tiktaalik It was exactly what one would expect a transitional fishtetrapod to look like and was found in deposits dated 375 mya If this was not the direct ancestor of tetrapods it was something very much like itThis is a great example of using evolutionary theory as a predictive tool The genetic variation within a population is referred to as a gene pool Organisms can move freely within that population breeding with each other perpetuating any new mutations that work and eliminating those that are less than optimalEach offspring will most resemble its parents yet will vary slightly genetically because of unique mutations acquired during meiosis Thus the genetic makeup of a population will change ever so slightly with each successive generation Populations are not stable they expand and contract with changing conditions So long as there is sufficient genetic variation within a population there will be some members capable of surviving those conditions and perpetuating the species The alternative is extinction When populations expand and migrate to new territories some portions of it will become genetically isolated from each other and no longer share a common gene pool In such cases each such sub population will carry a subset of the parent population but subsequent mutations will be unique to each new population the genotype that will come to differentiate that population from others Genetic Drift To the extent that such populations encounter differing environmental conditions that environment will exert different evolutionary pressures on that population New mutations will have a much greater chance of coming to dominance within a smaller population than they would in the larger parent population where they would be one among the many Over thousands of generations genetic differences accumulate in the different gene pools making interbreeding ever more difficult until at some point speciation can be said to have occurred Because speciation is a process rather than an event it would be no more possible to pinpoint where speciation occurred than to identify where on the color spectrum orange becomes red,neutral,News,neutral

*EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION  The Predictive Ability of the Theory  Part I* The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions Perhaps the greatest tests for any theory is their use as a predictive tool and the Theory of Evolution does that beautifully The first fossils were discovered quite by accident incidental to some other human activity There are still fossils discovered that way but no paleontologist will count on accidental discoveries Expeditions seeking particular fossils are planned meticulously Fifty years ago creationists could derisively point to the fact that science had no transitional whale fossils But then with the aid of geologic maps funded in part by oil and mineral companies and the Theory of Evolution predicting when in geologic time such fossils were likely to be found paleontologists were able to locate where in the world the proper marine sediments were exposed at the earths surface As each new discovery came to light they each showed a range of features from inherited to derived Each was consistent with what would be expected if the theory was correct There was no evidence of a derived feature returning to a more primitive form No derived feature occurring out of place in the geologic record When Neil Shubin and his team sought a fossil with transitional features between fish and tetrapod they knew that the earliest tetrapod fossils were found in fresh water sediments dated about 370 million years ago It was reasonable to assume that a transitional fossil if such existed would most likely be found in similar sediments somewhat older perhaps those dated at about 375 mya Geologic maps indicated that there are few places in the world where such layers are exposed at the earths surface but one they deemed to have the greatest probability of success was on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic Not exactly ones ideal summer vacation spot It took four expeditions in the very short Arctic summers but they returned in 2004 with nine fossil specimens of a fish they named Tiktaalik It was a fish but a fish like no other It had scales gills and a swimming tail but it also had lungs a sturdy rib cage and muscular fins ideal for pushing through weedy shallow marshes Those fins had the same arrangement of bones found in land based animals One bone humerus forelimb or femur hind limb Two bones ulna and radius forelimb or tibia and fibula hind limb followed by metacarpals and phalanges Even more interesting was the flattened head with eyes on top whose focus would have been at or above the waters surface and a neck that allowed it to move its head without having to move its whole body Here was a Devonian fish capable of breathing air watching at the waters surface most likely for the insects and other arthropods that millions of years earlier had followed plants in colonizing the land Recent research has revealed that eyes are very expensive tissue in terms of calorie consumption That is why cave dwelling organisms are quite often blind The limited food sources in those caves are the environmental pressure for the elimination of superfluous tissue Experiments have shown that larger eyes only marginally improve underwater vision but can increase air vision 100 fold While we cannot for certain determine the eye size of extinct organisms the size of the eye socket provides a pretty good approximation Tiktaaliks eye sockets were quite large indicating it was most likely searching for prey above the waters surface This is a fish at the margin of land and water with many features that would have suited it on land We cannot be certain that this fish or its progeny was the ancestor of all tetrapods but if not it was something very similar to it As previously stated the defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions The Theory of Evolution pointed to where such a fossil would be found and indeed it was,neutral,News,neutral

function They are not necessarily useless as some people assume Just as humans inherit characteristics of their nearest relatives each of us has characteristics inherited from more distant relatives In the inner corners of your eyes you have what is called a semilunar fold or plica semilunaris There is a muscle attached to it but it doesnt do anything in humans In many other animals sharks frogs birds your cat however that muscle controls a transparent nictitating membrane or third eyelid that can be drawn over the eye Proponents of intelligent design have no explanation as to why humans have those muscles They are perfectly consistent with evolutionary theory as vestigial remnants of an ancestral characteristic You also have three sets of muscles attached to your ears In other animals those muscles turn the ears to focus on the direction of a sound This ability is found in monkeys most of which cannot turn their head horizontally Humans and the other apes can turn their heads vertically and the ability to move the ears is largely lost in those species Using sensitive electronic devices researches find that the human brain is still sending nerve impulses to those muscles in response to sounds but the most any human can do is a bit of a wiggle Proponents of intelligent design have no explanation as to why humans have those muscles They are perfectly consistent with evolutionary theory as vestigial remnants of an ancestral characteristic Then there is the Plantaris Muscle which in other primates facilitates arboreal lifestyle allowing the feet to function much the same as hands in gripping branches The human foot has lost this ability rather early on it seems in the process of becoming bipedal The muscle however is still there It is a long pencil thin muscle and tendons running down the back of the calf that are extremely painful when ruptured and often misdiagnosed as a more serious injury This injury often called Tennis Leg occurs most frequently in athletes over 40 due to the tendon and attachments becoming more brittle With or without treatment the two ends of the rupture will shrivel and disappear within weeks with no loss of function in the leg It is indeed one of evolutions leftovers It is often harvested for reconstructive surgery elsewhere in the body That these muscles are still present in the human body indicates that the genetic instructions for them are still present in the human genome and active to some extent At some point the genes for these traits may be silenced by a mutation that disables a gene such as a premature STOP codon or frame shift making them a pseudo gene one which no longer produces a protein There is evidence that is already happening as this muscle is absent in one leg or both in about 10 of the population The same seems to be happening with wisdom teeth In the wild primate infants are capable of grasping and holding on to the mothers fur shortly after birth allowing the mother to pursue other activities Human infants because of the limited birth canal and large human brain must enter this world at a much earlier stage of physical and neuronal development Despite that the developing human embryo exhibits a grasping reflex in the uterus as early as 16 weeks Even at birth that reflex the Palmar Grip Reflex is incredibly strong as most parents of newborns will attest While it is capable of supporting the childs weight one must exercise caution as the child may suddenly let go This reflex may persist up to 6 months after birth As this is of no benefit to a human child it is vestigial All Great Apes including humans have an appendix In other apes the appendix is quite large and a repository for bacteria which help to digest the leaves that make up a large part of their diet In humans it is called the vermiform worm shaped appendix and is minuscule While some hypothesize that our appendix is a repository for good bacteria to replenish out gut biota following diarrhea the fact is that a hot appendix can kill you whereas those who have had it removed go on to lead normal lives The vomeronasal organ VNO is an organ located at the base of the dividing wall between right and left nostrils nasal septum It is present in most amphibia reptiles and mammals but absent in birds and adult Old World catarrhine monkeys which include apes and humans It enables the detection of pheromones via pheromone receptor VR genes that produce proteins sensitive to certain biochemical signals The VNO is clearly present in the human fetus but appears to be atrophied or absent in adults and is thus vestigial The VR genes plentiful in other species while present in the human genome are all or almost all disabled by mutations making them pseudogenes again vestigial remnants Pseudogenes are vestiges of previously active genes that have been disabled by some mutation and no longer produce a protein There are some 20000 of them n the human genome many of them remnants of Olfactory Receptor scent receptor genes While humans have lost an additional 30 of these genes since our ancestral lineage separated from that of chimps most of those pseudogenes are handmedowns from even more remote relatives but disabled by exactly the same mutations again evidence of common ancestry We see vestigial structures all through nature They remain in some cases because they have been adapted for other purposes in others they remain simply because there has been no evolutionary advantage to eliminating them They certainly do not support the idea of intelligent design They are however completely consistent with the Theory of Evolution,neutral,News,neutral

So a group of the earliest hunter gatherers were standing at the mouth of a cave watching a heavy thunderstorm Lightening struck a nearby tree and all but one man scrambled for shelter deeper into the cave Uhhg was a tad less frightened he had seen lightening strikes before In fact Uhhg approached the tree and picked up a branch that was aflame Soon the others found their courage and gathered around Uhhg They were praising the obvious courage he had displayed in not running for his life Uhhg was a smart feller He said that a voice had commanded him to remain when the others fled The voice told him that the fire was heaven sent and as long as it burnt Uhhgs people would prosper Uhhg said the voice had instructed him to keep the holy fire burning The voice also said the men would go on a hunt and that hunt would be successful The best of the meat was to be given to Uhhg to make an offering to the voice that only he could hear The men gathered wood for the holy fire They went on the hunt and left Uhhg to commune with the voice Thus was born religion As societies evolved so did religion Christians laugh at ancient Greek and Roman religions and insist they were based on myths Yet Christian beliefs hang upon a talking serpent a talking burning bush and a boat that held two of every species Religion was conceived to control the masses Nothing has changed except the numbers involved It is still all about wealth and power,neutral,News,neutral

My original post seems to have been taken down for some reason who removes a post promoting peace Heres a repost I think some things should be cleared up Firstly evolution is not we evolved from apes That makes no sense and has no evidence Evolution of humans is to say that we evolved from an ancestor in common with apes over a very long period of time millions and millions of years In other words that common ancestor was one we had a very long time ago and not a species that is alive today and can be identified Also people often inaccurately characterize a theory as an idea that hasnt been proven yet which is also false A scientific theory is an explanation for something a scientific law which is what people assume to be a proven theory is a description of something we observe But people will believe what they believe by heart or mind by tradition or simply by the enormous number of world influences which have led us to stick to stable and unvarying opinions Ultimately all that matters is that we can agree to live by good moral principles and with common purpose So when atheists in this comments section for example tell theists to kill themselves they arent doing much good to justify their beliefs Or conversely when theists tell atheists they are superior to all other life and that atheists will suffer the wrath of God clearly they do not fully comprehend the advocacy for love and forgiveness by their own faith I implore both atheists and theists to leave an open mind to the others perspective because really we cannot yet prove who is correct on the creation of the universe beyond minor evidence and faith though it is a goal of humanity to solve this impossible question eventually To finish with a quote by Marcus Aurelius Live a good life If there are Gods and they are just then they will not care how devout you have been but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by If there are Gods but unjust then you should not want to worship them If there are no Gods then you will be gone but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones and I might add it is not divisiveness but togetherness which will in the end determine exactly how the human race perseveres and what direction we take in our final departure away from the pale blue dot Live with happiness and magnanimity overcome your red sorrows and embrace others even those you would otherwise consider to be enemies Then it does not matter who is right or wrong we will have transcended the greatest of moral barriers Ssschah,neutral,News,neutral

*EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION  Evolution Makes Testable Predictions* The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions In the 1950s when it was discovered that humans had 23 pairs of chromosomes one from each parent whereas the other great apes chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans had 24 pairs creationists were ecstatic thinking they finally had evidence to counter common ancestry Chromosomes are packages of DNA that form during mitosis and meiosisThere are two sets one inherited from each parent Other Great Apes have 48 chromosomes 24 pairs 1n24 2n48 whereas humans have 46 chromosomes 23 pairs 1n23 2n46 Evolution made a testable prediction That somewhere in the human genome we should find evidence of cromosomal fusion In other words we should be able to find a human chromosome with the remnants of extra telomeres and centomeres Since the loss of all the genes in a chromosome would have been fatal to any species scientists reasoned that IF the Theory of Evolution was correct about common ancestry one of two things must have occurred Either two chromosomes had fused in humans evolutionary past OR chromosomes had split in the other apes Using Occams Razor or the law of parsimony which states that among competing hypotheses the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected Simply put it means that the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one the most likely event was chromosome fusion in humans Normal chromosomes have a centromere and ends capped with telomeres It was reasoned that IF two chromosomes had fused evidence for such an event would be found in a chromosome with two centromeres and teleomeres where they did not belong That is exactly what was found in human chromosome 2 chromosomes are numbered by length It was subsequently discovered that chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13 for comparative purposes designated as 2A and 2B or 2p and 2q contained the same genes as human chromosome 2 and if placed end to end the positions of those genes matched those of the human chromosome Those chromosomes in the other apes also lined up in a similar fashion The fusion event has been confirmed In just the last few years science has gained largely complete genomes of two other human species those of Neanderthal and Denisovans We see that same chromosome fusion in their genomes as well indication that the fusion event took place in a common ancestor As previously stated the defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge including theories is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions The greatest test of ANY scientific theory is in its usefulness as a predictive tool In this case as with others the Theory of Evolution has performed beautifully,neutral,News,neutral

It is impossible to keep a great white in captivity because of the sharks size and the fact they must keep moving due to their size and the way they sleep when they sleep its gliding through the water towards the bottom at an angle these sharks can grow to 23ft in length and the girth on these animals is phenomenal they may last in captivity anywhere from 35 days depending on the size and depth of aquarium these animals must remain in the open ocean to live not in a aquarium where their lifespan will be cut short these are magnificent animals and we can appreciate them better by leaving them where they are free in the ocean,neutral,News,positive

The Crash was not due to Concorde Tyres was it Absolute tripe If youre hurtling down the runway at 250mph and you run over a shard of metal 17 inches long off the intake of a Douglas DC10 that took off a minute before your tyre is going to burst There had been blowouts on Concorde before but more than any other aircraft at the time Because the Concorde had a fast takeoff speed a blowout was more likely to cause damage to the air frame AirFrance did not correctly Fuel the Aircraft They overfilled the fuel tanks and exceeded the MTOW of the plane As an aeronautical engineer I find this surprising because this is a number fundamental to the design and certification of any aircraft So essentially Air France was responsible as well as the Operator of the DC10 You could argue the DC10 was a flawed design It had many crashes where parts would fall off it The Manufacturing Quality of the DC10 was abysmal The DC10 was only 5 years older than Concorde It has so far been in 55 Accidents 32 of which were complete losses and has killed 1261 people Thank god it is not in operational Service They should have Grounded the DC10 as well when Concorde crashed Bits falling off it constantly In Conclusion Vox are terrible Journalists,neutral,News,neutral

I think the premise is false I would argue that the Concorde was not a failure at all The fact that it was in service from 1976 to 2003 27 years and experienced only one catastrophic accident was a tribute to how robust the aircraft was especially given all the advanced features it employed The retirement of the Concorde was due mostly to external factors related to changes in air travel in general global economic factors and increasing maintenance costs There was nothing wrong with the airframe itself save for a design flaw in the landing gear a flaw that ended up leading to the Air France 4590 accident Had the economic outlook been better its possible that the gear issue would have been fixed and they would still be flying today,neutral,News,neutral

My favorite thing is when I go in the right lane wiht a cozy speed not under the limit someone catches up to me with very little speed difference moves into the left lane with the same speed I keep my speed too or maybe slow down a bit to make the takeover easier and this car just drives behind me for 10km 6 miles or more Guys if you want to pass pass if you dont stay in the right lane And if you pass dont slow down below the speed of the car you just passed,neutral,News,neutral

Here in the Indiana the left lanes arent so much Passing lanes as they are fast lanes especially on roads with more than 4 lanes The left lanes do move faster but more often than not people tend to stay in the left lanes as opposed to simply using them to pass The end result is that you get lots of people who will CASUALLY pass on the right Not even making statement passes just causally passing on the right Ive been in several nearmisses on roads that have more than 4 lanes where another person tries to merge into the same lane that Im trying to merge into And yes Ill admit that I casually pass on the right far more often than I should,neutral,News,neutral

I cant help but note deviation from average speed Quality bit of data interpretation there where the dumbed down for quick political gain would be speed kills Now on that point even keeping to the rightleft dependent on country has a drawback being slower drivers who are not consistently slow Youre in a commercial motor on a speed limiter someone in the incorrectly titled slow lane is going slower than you So you pull out to overtake the driver then speeds up and you cannot get past That has caused all sorts of issues in my many years of driving usually as they merely match your speed when you were doing 10mph more comfortably This leaves the issue of sitting there vs slowing down and trying to drop in behind them And often slowing down is not a choice because of a stack of vehicles behind you or no space behind the suddenly accelerating car because of other cars The result is a queue and the blame gets levied on the poor sod in a commercial motor,neutral,News,neutral

Yesit is the rule that you should stick to the rightthe left lane is for faster driving vehicles and for passing BUT here is the problem There always is going to be someone else driving faster than you You might be driving slightly faster than the rest of traffic so you might think its OK to be in the left lane to pass other cars So you get over to the left and instantly here comes someone rushing up on your bumper No matter how fast you are going you are always going to have someone thinking its a car race and try to pass you If the speed limit is 50 and you are doing 60 you will have a string of jerks who want to do 70 If you speed up to 70 you will have people wanting to do 80 and so on It never ends It is like a chain reaction No matter how fast you speed up it makes everyone else want to go faster than you If you get over to the left to pass another car it makes everyone else in back of you do the same If someone is in the right lane going very slow when you pass them the cars in back of you are going to do the same plus attempt to pass you as well even though you were not the problem They will not simply pass the first car they will stay over to the left and floor it attempting to pass every car in sight even though those cars are already speeding,neutral,News,neutral

I experienced the first hand experience of using left lane only for Lane change and in my one drive on motorwayhighway in Poland I saw two accidents and i could really witness potential accident scenarios multiple times The issue here is if people use left lane only to pass we are not sure when a particular person going to come into left lane and its leading to multiple lane changes I can see people going back and forth into left lane and right lane which is really dangerous I prefer US style of driving using left lane for fast traffic and as we move away from divider the speed reduces gradually Keeping left lane only to pass is too dangerous,neutral,News,neutral

Let me explain why the German Autobahn works without speed limits and accident rates are low The Autobahn is generally maintained very well in the first place second on those stretches that actually are without speed limits drivers do not only tend to keep right unless they are passing but they also drive extremely cautiously when they pass This is due to the fact that you dont want to get rearended by someone driving 160mph in the left lane while you switch into it with 80mph So not only does the lack of a speed limit tend to get drivers to keep right it also forces them to switch lanes extremely cautiously opposed to what can be observed in many other countries This means that the drivers have to stay focused similarily to a situation in which you try to find way in a big unknown city,neutral,News,neutral

Possible practical reason gloves help keep their fur away from everything including their food  Possible animation reason it allows the viewer to see what the hands are doing especially if a character has a complexion dark enough to unwillingly hide the individual fingers Also 4 fingers are much easier to animate than 5 fingers and doesnt take away from what the hands are doing,neutral,News,neutral

Before you think this is a way of rigging the game its not for the average Saturday afternoon bowler The oil patter then typically use for open bowling is such that it will guide the ball toward the center or the strike zone so bowlers dont get frustrated and get better scores For semiserious bowlers like league bowlers they are well aware of the patterns and can either adjust to the conditions or change to a hardersofter ball Its part of the game There are also many different patterns that give different results Something else to consider a freshly conditioned lane is ideal for a serious bowler Its predictable Since the oil only goes down about 3545 feet you get that distinct hook at the last moment the latter part of the lane is dry the ball spin grabs and the ball hooks Now after several games on a lane the oil gets carried all the way down to the pins so you have to either move a board or two over or switch balls Anyway without oil bowling would be boring and predictable,neutral,News,neutral

Youll likely never experience the ideal condition of these oil patterns if you dont bowl in a league or tournament If you bowl in a league youll likely experience it on the 2nd to last night of the season when the league teams are bowling for final placement in the standings The last night of the season is sweeps and award ceremony based on the league ending stats from the week before And youll experience it bowling in a tournament So how do you use this knowledge In a league or tournament use the practice period to see how your ball is responding to the oil condition of the lane If you need to adjust you can move so youre putting your ball down on a different board and you can aim at a different arrow or board I suppose you can also adjust the amount of spin you add to the ball I threw a straight ball and never purposely tried to adjust the spin on my ball,neutral,News,neutral

This video was about oil but one important piece not mentioned is the actual ball itself There is a weight inside the ball A house ball will have the weight in the very center This is to help amateurs keep it straight in the middle of the lane Bowlers who use their own ball have the finger holes drilled in a certain spot so that the weight is off center In the video he talks about the ball hooking back to the pocket once it passes the oil This is helped by that off center weight inside the ball There is definitely a certain wrist action in throwing a curve ball but the majority of the movement to that sweet spot in the pocket is done by the offset weight bringing it there You just have to make sure you have thrown the ball so that weight reacts at the right time,neutral,News,neutral

This video is kind of biased It talks about cardiovascular exercises like Jogging and Cycling What they do is burn calories directly But what they missed out was looking at High Intensity exercises like Sprinting and Lifting weights Lifting weights builds muscle mass in your body And this in turn increases the work your body has to put into utilizing the muscles and thus increases your Resting Metabolism which happens to also be the number 1 factor in affecting the calories you burn Not to discredit the video but they were absolutely right in saying that diet ultimately is the main issue but they shouldnt say that exercising is ineffective,neutral,News,neutral

I am studying as an undergraduate about to finish my degree in exercise Physiology at Kennesaw State University This video though mostly true leaves out some very important details Exercise is extremely important to overall health and eating is extremely important for weight control However the research done here is interpreted in a way that downplays the effects ofexercise on weight The effects of exercise go far beyond the acuteie the right there and theneffects of a single workout Exercise will burn a small amount of calories during a workout but the small amounts of damage and trauma done to the body during a regular bout of exercise need time and energy to repair Your body has to recover and repair itself after every workout This can almost double the energy expended in the workout sometimes Resistance training is a great example You burn very few calories lifting weights but as the body rebuilds itself and prepares for the next bout it uses so much more energy throughout the rest of the day even into the next day that the effects are magnified Not only is this working in your advantage but also when new muscle tissue is created itbegins demanding nutrients regularly and adds to your Basal Metabolic Rate or the amount of energy you require just to maintain your current body weight So you burn more fat in your sleep Even though the effects may not be as blatantly obvious for weight loss as slowlystarving yourself until you reach a goal weight exercise plays a huge and irreplaceable role in weight management,neutral,News,neutral

Weight lifting is a form of exercise If you develop more lean muscle tissue it increases your resting metabolism to sustain muscle Which they stated is the most effective consumption of daily energy needs ,positive,News,positive
Pointless video Losing weight depends on the balance between incoming energy and burning energy If we assume that an average person burns aprox 1800 caloriesday that person needs to consume less calories than this ammount in order to lose weight Each calorie corresponds to a quantity of body weight We can lose weight either by increasing our calories burning rythm which can be done most effectivelly by excersise and by decreasing our food consumption in terms of calories intake Of course if we increase both intake and burning by the same ammount the balance doesnt change but it is ridigelous to blame excersise about it The most efficient way to lose weight is to excersise a bit to increase the daily calorie burn by excersise and to decrease the energy consumption simultaneously Excersise alongside a proper diet works better because the weight loss is undoubtedly faster and healthier maintaining or even increasing muscle mass and lossing only fat in comparison with diet alone,neutral,News,neutral
As some others have said mostly true Simply put weight loss is about expending more energy than what is consumed Doesnt matter whether thats eating less or exercising more That said metabolic function has been grossly simplified in the video While it is true that the body can and will adapt to exercise it takes awhile for this to happen This is why resistance training requires changing things up changing acute variables such as volume resistance tempo etc But the body also adjusts to eating less It will also cause your Basal Metabolic Rate to go down And for that reason this video gets it majorly wrong If you lose weight through food onlyprimarily the metabolic adaptations will be worse than theyd be if you did so onlyprimarily via exercise especially resistance training At some point your body will start burning lean muscle and that will be problematic because lean muscle tissue requires more energy to maintain and thus your BMR will go down The reality is that the better way to lose weight is to eat less eat a better variety of nutrientdense foods and exerciseespecially resistance training But what do I know I only lost 150 lbs,neutral,News,neutral

This video obscures two crucial points about health and exercise 1 Your basal metabolic rate is under your control and anaerobic exercise is how you control it This video talks about exercise as if aerobic exercise were the only kind that counted Anaerobic exercise eg weight lifting rock climbing etc will add muscle which will raise your resting calorie consumption 2 Weight is not the primary health risk Body fat percentage is the primary health risk Weight is easier and more satisfying to measure But the fast ways of losing weight all cause muscle loss which will sabotage your basal metabolic rate See point 1,positive,News,positive

Obvious statement is obvious but sure for *purely* losing weight exercise isnt the best way as a standalone option You exercise you gain muscle weight you burn fat less weight than muscle Thing is the better physical shape you get in the more efficient your body becomes at burning stored fat and retaining or building muscle which provides physical and mental health benefits as well as a reduction in visceral fat which is more important than simply focusing on losing weight Only exercise as a weight loss means isnt best Only changing your diet as a weight loss means isnt best Only changing your sleeping habits isnt best If you have excessive body fat the best solution to eliminate that excessive fat is to combine proper exercise with proper healthy foods with proper sleeping patterns Human physiology isnt meant to handle sitting at a desk for 8 hours then sitting in a car for an hour then sitting on the sofa at home watching TV for the rest of the evening while drinking sugary garbage,positive,News,positive

Are you confused about what is going on in the Middle East Allow me to explain from a USUK perspective We The West support the Iraqi government in their fight against ISIS We dont like ISIS but ISIS is supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar whom we do like because we love our oil nice and cheap The Iraqi government is getting help from Iran to fight ISIS but we dont like Iran because they dont like listening to us Now coming to Syria We dont like Syrian President Bashar Al Assad whos a big baddie because he is friends with other big baddies like Russia and Iran So we support the fight against Assad by arming training and funding moderate rebels because overthrowing Assad means we can put a goodie ie someone who will listen to us in his place So we do not cooperate with the baddies Assad Iran and Russia who btw are also at war with ISIS to collectively defeat ISIS even though defeating ISIS is supposedly our number one priority in ME because the baddies are also attacking our moderate rebels without whom our regime change plan would fail So some of our friends are supporting some of our enemies and some of our enemies are kind of like our friends cos theyre fighting against our other enemies whom we want to lose but we also dont want our enemies who are fighting our other enemies to win because theyre also our enemies So right now we dont know which one of our enemies we want for to win and which one of them we want for to loseand while we make up our minds the war rages on for which all parties need more and more weapons to continue waging and since we are the biggest weapons exporter in the world more warmore money so I guess perpetual warfare is just what the doctor ordered And lets not forget this whole mess started in the first place by our ILLEGALLY invading a country in search of WMDs that NEVER existed to drive out terrorists who only cropped up AFTER we went in to drive them out Do you understand now,neutral,News,neutral

This was a great video Id just like to also add that it isnt necessarily true that movie creators back in the day didnt know that theyre doing uncanny material but I personally feel like there was this huge ideal in the 19902000s that followed the more realistic the better We were breaking through computational power that pushed the boundaries that was supposed to blur the lines between realism and the fake and I think everything there followed suit we had this idea that now everything could become real instead of pretend everything that we simulated like legos dolls actionfigures all of it could now become as real as we always dreamed they would be But then I think we kind of sobered up when we saw the result Fully realistic ISNT always better It also kind of highlighted that we all add so different things to our play We all said yeah wouldnt it be awesome if this toy was real but then when we see a full 3Danimated version on the screen that follows one persons idea of what that means 999 other people disagree Because thats what we do we fill in the gaps of what we expect there to be but what these gaps are filled with can vary I think it is related to Gestalt Psychology where you can see a triangle that is full of gaps and still recognize it as a triangle the same way we can find highcontrasting imagery of people with few details to be more beautiful because we fill in the gap of what we imagine to be beautiful where these details are gone So I think now in this day and age we have two paths One that is still going ultrarealistic and one that is just trying to see the charm in the things as they are Like the lego movie but also indiegames that are satisfied with not having topnotch graphics but just enough,positive,News,positive

525 this is such a great casestudy for how derivative works ought to be treated under copyrighttrademark law A fan makes a derivative work and Lego has the ability to shut it down Meanwhile Lego makes a work thats highly derivative of what those very fans make and everythings fine and people even seem to think wow its so cool that they made shoutouts to all the fans in the form of deriving or even using verbatim their art Anyway it sounds like Lego came around pretty quickly But not every company does and maybe the law ought to be structured so that both individuals and companies are always treated equally when it comes to derivatives by code,neutral,News,positive

EXPLANATIONS What are some of the international law mistakes in this video longexplanation Hello everyone First of all I would like to say that Vox always do a wonderful job at describing a geopolitical conflict unfortunately in this video there are many international law mistakes Im a French Canadian Law School student currently studying international law and Im writing this message because many people asked me to explain what are these mistakes next week I have 5 midterms so I wont have time to explain in details everything that is wrong in this video but I will point out a few of them very very quick Mistake number 1 at 200 Vox says that But any area that isnt in the EEZ 200 miles of the shore is regarded as international waters it means everybody shares it This is misleading because its not 100 right Some countries have a continental shelf art 76 of the The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS Basically what it means is that some countries have rights in an area that exceed 200 miles but shall not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured And in these 350 nautical miles art 77 UNCLOS Rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources So saying that everyone can share the resources that isnt in the 200 miles is not true all of the time Mistake number 2 lets talk about the Spratly Islands at 310 Vox says that any countries that can claim the Spratly Islands can extend their EEZ to include them and gain exclusive rights to the surrounding territories This is FALSE To understand why lets take a look at art 121 UNCLOS An island is a naturally formed area of land surrounded by water which is above water at high tide Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf And now in the case law The republic of the Philippines v the peoples republic of China it clearly states at paragraph 622 that  The Tribunal having concluded that none of the hightide features in the Spratly Islands is capable of sustaining human habitation or an economic life of their own the effect of Article 1213 is that such features shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf The Tribunal concluded that this provision depends upon the objective capacity of a feature in its natural condition to sustain either a stable community of people or economic activity that is not dependent on outside resources or purely extractive in nature The Tribunal noted that the current presence of official personnel on many of the features is dependent on outside support and not reflective of the capacity of the features There are many more mistakes in this video but honestly its almost 1AM and Im tired AF But Id like to point out that maybe the US does not intervene in the LEGAL conflict between The Philippines and China because the US never signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seanot because it wants to evoid WW3 English is my second language dont hate Goodnight everyone hope you liked my reply,neutral,News,neutral

Well made video no doubt but it was wrong about something important When the Arab armies invaded Israel upon Independence they did not wish to create a Unified Palestinian state they wanted to grab it to themselves This is important because hiding this fact can give an impression Palestinians are more separate from other Arabs then they really are In reality this separation is little different then the one between Iraq Syria and Jordan  European enforced with little more to it Another large miss is the never changing goal of the Arab armies and Palestinian militias of their Jewish question The Jewish expulsion from Arab states is also ignored which makes over 50 of Israeli Jews Ignoring this makes it easier to see Israel as colonial and the comment that extreme Israelis want to destroy the Palestinians is laughable That argument only goes the other way All this together can give the common wrong impression the conflict is more about how much land people control rather then security and acceptance of the other sides self determination Which is the larger tobesettled issue,neutral,News,neutral

I was banned from a supermarket once because I fell victim to their bad design In Germany you have to return used bottles to the supermarket So I went to this supermarket with a couple of bottles and there was a sign that indicated where to return them I walked there and there was a door that said fire safety door  must not be held open So I thought oh I guess I have to open it then So I opened it and there was the machine that said ready and accepted my bottles But then an employee of the supermarket stomped at me really angrily and banned me from the store because I was not supposed to open that door It was ridiculous because there was no way to know that so I asked to talk to the owner to clear things up but he agreed that I should be banned from the store and he was like what should we do add a sign to the door As if that would be something that was unthinkable Wow it still aggravates me today,neutral,News,neutral
In the us most doors that are the entry and exit point for a room that has a capacity of more than 20 are to be pushed on exit and pulled on entry due to fire code There was an infamous fire in Chicago where a lot of people burned alive because the crowd mobbed the door which made it impossible to pull it open Since then this rule has been the standard I hardly ever get doors wrong no matter how poorly designed they are due to my knowledge of this so hopefully spreading the word will help some others too,neutral,News,neutral

I love the video  looks like the door at Vox though was designed as a doubleswinging door  this is pretty common for frameless glass doors as putting a push plate on one side looks really ugly from the other side Then probably postinstallation the access control card swipe guys have come along and installed a magnetic clamp locking device at the top of the doors you can see this in the video making them only able to open inwards I see this happening all the time typically due to cost  systems which support doubleswinging doors are much more expensive and less reliable at locking compared to a magnetic clamp on a door that only swings one way,neutral,News,neutral

v t e American South in the War of 1812 show v t e Naval battles of the War of 1812 The War of 1812 18121815 was a conflict fought between the United States the United Kingdom and their respective allies Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars in the United States and Canada it is seen as a war in its own right Since the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France which the United States contested as illegal under international law To man the blockade Britain impressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy Incidents such as the ChesapeakeLeopard affair inflamed antiBritish sentiment In 1811 the British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in which 11 British sailors died1415 The British supplied Indians who conducted raids on American settlers on the frontier which hindered American expansion and also provoked resentment16 Historians remain divided on whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America contributed to the American decision to go to war On June 18 1812 United States President James Madison after receiving heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress signed the American declaration of war into law17 With the majority of their army in Europe fighting Napoleon the British adopted a defensive strategy American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity especially in New England where it was derogatorily referred to as Mr Madisons War American defeats at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights thwarted attempts to seize Upper Canada improving British morale American attempts to invade Lower Canada and capture Montreal also failed In 1813 at the Battle of Lake Erie the Americans won control of Lake Erie and at the Battle of the Thames defeated Tecumsehs Confederacy securing a primary war goal At sea the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will In 1814 one of these raids burned the capital Washington although the Americans subsequently repulsed British attempts to invade New England and capture Baltimore At home the British faced mounting opposition to wartime taxation and demands to reopen trade with America With the abdication of Napoleon the blockade of France ended and the British ceased impressment rendering the issue of the impressment of American sailors moot The British were then able to increase the strength of the blockade on the United States coast annihilating American maritime trade and bringing the United States government near to bankruptcy Peace negotiations began in August 1814 and the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24 as neither side wanted to continue fighting News of the peace did not reach America for some time Unaware that the treaty had been signed British forces invaded Louisiana and were defeated at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 These late victories were viewed by Americans as having restored national honour leading to the collapse of antiwar sentiment and the beginning of the Era of Good Feelings a period of national unity News of the treaty arrived shortly thereafter halting military operations The treaty was unanimously ratified by the United States on February 17 1815 ending the war with status quo ante bellum no boundary changes,neutral,News,neutral

Mistakes AKP didnt intend to help the religious oppressed by secularism always They became antisecular in late 2000s Before that Erdogan looked pretty liberal he even said he was pro LGBT rights The coup was not a secular coup it was staged by another religious group The Kemalist leaders of the army were purged in an investigation called Ergenekon years before the coup The army havent been Kemalists since then The Kemalists were replaced by FETO members a very large islamist group which allegedly staged the coup The referendum was rigged The electoral council started counting unofficial ballots midcount and a Turkish news agency started releasing official YesNo percentages way before the electoral council did no one really knows how they got the numbers before electoral council released them The count was live too so electoral council knew about this agency releasing its numbers and they let them There are a lot of speculations about this While it wasnt really a mistake its important to note that Ataturk was also a democratically selected dictator So its not like the Turkish people were all islamists and Ataturk tried forcing his ideas upon them And also most of his laws were democratically created in fact he only used his dictator powers in the war of independence Ban on headscarves wasnt done by Ataturk was done in the 90s and also it wasnt a total ban Only from government institutions,neutral,News,neutral

Main things that need to be corrected in the video according to me are 1 Ataturk had somewhat dictatorialish powers as the founder plus he had almost full support of the citizens as the war hero But he didnt want to be a dictator as he tried to bring multiparty system a few times unfortunately couldnt manage to do it before his death because in every attempt small but somewhat effective Islamist groups who hated secular change tried to abuse it caused him to postpone the plans before it becomes a major crisis Also the only thing he dictated was secularism related stuff which he thought was the only way to protect the country from repeating the later Ottoman mistakes 2 Headscarfs were only banned for public servants only during their jobs in their work place and for students Its purpose was whether you agree or not if its the right decision to prevent discrimination between women wearing headscarfs and who are not in the process of getting government jobs promoted or getting grades as students andor to prevent creating any concern of discrimination in the minds of people who receive the service Because significant percentage of Islamist people naturally without even thinking see headscarfed women as better muslims and has a bias that better muslims have higher morality so they couldshould be privileged Because of that notion and because you couldnt and shouldnt ban headscarfs from the public all together they thought this ban could at least minimize government based discrimination and any concern of discrimination of that kind Now the ban is over and after the referendum new laws and rules concerning publicservants are on the way which are going to weaken if not remove the jobsecurity of public servants bring lesstransparent and corruptable recruitment methods and promotion standards As a result naturally female publicservants who are not wearing head scarfs are one of the groups that feel under threat which is also an example of those discrimination concerns I tried to explain 3 The 2016 coup was not executed by secular Kemalists Theres an Islamist movement which began in 60s or 70s following a cult leader called Fethullah Gulen which slowly grew socially and ecconomicly by connecting with mainly religious conservative less educated and lowincome people of Turkey in the name of so called public service and Islam Provided scholarships for poor peoples kids helped their education tried to attract clever students to their schools and other educational structures Tried succeded in some degree to brainwash suitable religios oriented kids detected throughout their education with Gulens teachings making them believe they serve for a higher holly purpose Later canalized them into studying especially management law and other fields which are main branches recruited in the government Then tried to placeinfiltrate its followers who act as theyre not from the movement first in the critical duties which are related to recruitment promotion justice department intelligence and police then in time all around the government except military in some degree as military was more selective and also had strict disciplinary methods against possible cultist or Islamists The Gulen movements secrets and goals begin to be exposed by journalists secular politicians and those claims had decent media coverage in the late 90s and early 2000s Investigations began which caused Gulen to flee to USA but after AKP Erdogans party came to power in 2002 the allegations were quickly dropped and media coverage began to diminish except secular oppositions constant warning about the threat which AKP dismissed until 2014 or so In AKP ruling the Gulen movement became stronger and stronger in the government law and police force and in every field of governmental public service as AKP didnt have enough qualified people and built a partnership with them Also they passed laws that especially built a highway for Gulenists to rise in justice department They also managed to take control the government central exam system that recruits public servants and even military students Plus AKP constantly tried to weaken the military firewall I mentioned After Gulen had enough power in the police and justice department various antimilitary allegations investigations lawsuits began which ended up many military generals and highranked officers arrested using manifactured false evidence Although those evidence proven to be totally false and despite continous opposition warnings AKP supported those lawsuits for a long long time The imprisonement dismissal andor resignment of many generals and highranked officers opened a window for lowerranked secretly gulenist officers to rise in the military which they took and Gulen had a decent power in the military as a result After AKP and Gulen movement had some disagreements in 2014 their fight for power began First Gulenist tried to bring down Erdogan with corruption lawsuits about ministers and their sons including Erdogans son using the concrete evidence they easily collected during their partnership and government power But Erdoan managed to tear the lawsuits down quickly using his political power fiercely and creating a vast media propaganda campaign using the media who he slowly took control over the years After this attempt he tried to weaken Gulen by confiscating media owned by Gulen which fanatically supported Erdogan until their breakup by the way and Gulen controlled companies and a bank of Gulens which are thought to be the main financial sources of Gulen organization Then comes the Gulenist officers coup attempt who werent enough to control the whole military which is why the coup attempt failed not that Erdogan invited people to streets If the whole military joined the coup with full power and didnt hesitate to use fire power againts resistance not only in a few places but everywhere nobody could stop it There are many uncovered secrets and serious doubts about the coup too but I wont be going there in this post because it would be speculation 4 Now Erdoan declared Gulen organisation as a terrorist one which is actually justified and he is using the coup attempt and state of emergency laws to get rid of any opposition because it made a perfect excuse for him to fire andor jail people at will as there really were many Gulenists in the government and in every part of the community but public doesnt know who are He and his supporters can blame anyone being a secret Gulenist and that is now a major oppression method going on He already accused the opposition being a partner with Gulenists the same opposition who constantly warned him about the Gulen threat and always fought against Gulens false lawsuits during the referendum Unfortunately if hes elected the president with the new powers which he probably will be because he already controls the election system in the justice department which declared about 25 million illegal votes legal during the referendum the power will singlehandedly be his and the state of emergency laws will be the norm in the country Added Hours after I wrote this the very popular biggest secular opposition newspaper which always has been against Gulen organisation and fight against their false lawsuits and its owner and editors are under heavy investigation for supposedly helping Gulen organisation and trying to overthrow the government Their buildings are being searched by the police at the moment Probably I am next for writing this comment

Dunkirk is a very different movie and not your standard war movie There is very little dialogue a very simple plot not much gore and almost no character development  I think I remember 1 characters name The movie is not for everyone because of how different it is and some will find it very boring That being said I really enjoyed it the sound was amazing and in every scene I felt completely immersed in what was happening I like how it show 3 different perspective of land air and sea and I like how the movie wasnt crazy long like other war movies If you havent seen it yet go into the movie expecting it to be different and you may or may not like it depending on what I mentioned,neutral,News,neutral

I had the pleasure of watching the film last Sunday at Phenomena cinema in Barcelona It was a 70mm showing with DTS audio Before the film began however one of the staff members a Director of Photography explained that Nolan himself had been to the cinema a couple of weeks before for a private showing and had calibrated the projector and audio to his liking His audio tastes were peculiar to say the least We were told that the volume we were going to experience was slightly lower than what Nolan requested due to how loud it was They were right every gunshot was deafening and the pacing of the film combined with the overwhelmingly loud soundtrack and immersive experience of the 70mm film made for an intense experience I was genuinely recoiled in my seat and physically recoiling with each gunshot,neutral,News,neutral

This was actually a very good video very informative and very correct good job thanks for bringing this situation to the world 1 The poor didnt bring Chavez to power it was the middle class The poor didnt even vote in 1998 that came later on 2 Chavez didnt spend millions on social programs for the poor Social programs existed before Chavez he just destroyed them when he came to power so that the government didnt have those expenses But then in a moment in time when he was unpopular he created social programs again this is when he brought the poor into the voting system and threw some money at them at this point oil prices were high so he could do that and still STEAL millions The social programs created by Chavez wereare HIGHLY inefficient zero transparency a lot of money goes into them and most of it disappears without yielding real world results other than propaganda 3 When Chavez was in government he didnt do any of those things because of good management he just had so much money oil went from 11 to 150 during his time in office that he could steal a lot and also give some back to the country Chavezs daughter is one of the richest persons in latin America 4 Chavez made the people dependent on the government He stole most of the privately owned companies in the country that actually produced and exported goods and then ran them to the ground because of unqualified workers taking over He had so much oil income that he basically gave very cheap dollars to new companies many from his friends to import goods instead of producing them here bringing Venezuelan companies to bankruptcy the ones he didnt steal He single handedly destroyed the country its just that Maduro is paying for it because oil prices went down on his watch 5 Updated black market rate is 17000 per dollar And the official rate for friends and family is 10 imagine how much money you can generate with that exchange system 6 Luisa Ortega Diaz is not an opposition leader more like a government defector that starting opposing it for her own political agenda She is as corrupt and disgusting as the ones currently in government but hey if you want to jump ship we will welcome you UPDATE 8 months later May 2018 you need to pay 950000 for a single dollar And it is expected to rise rapidly in the coming months,neutral,News,neutral

This happens if you relie so much on oil instead of spending the money on social welfare they should have spend the money on projects that will help the country in the longterm like funding companies that create jobs building infrastructure education and so on In the long term this would had the same effect This wouldve made the country richer where the goverment and most importantly its people would benefit of it  And they then dont have to relie on oil anymore i dont want to say that social welfare is bad but an system that is fully funded by oil and would break if oil prices drops like it happend in real life is stupid,neutral,News,neutral

video was too long Halfway through it I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich But then I found out that Im out of mayonnaise so I went to a store There I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life But Im really a shy person so I took up a threeyear personality development course so I can introduce my self She was very friendly and all but unfortunately she has a boyfriend So I said all good Im a mature person I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend so I did not bother her anymore But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her Then she broke up with her boyfriend we drank some alcohol because of it I told her shell be fine and I wished her well I still think shes the most beautiful woman in the world but like I said I am over my crush on her It was like five seconds already when I first saw her Besides I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her It was more important than a crush So we kept hanging out drinking having coffee and all I had a girlfriend she started dating other guys My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it so I said okay I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately But we were really drunk so she spent the night in my apartment I only have one bed so you know what that means She took the bed and I slept on the couch But on the couch I really cant sleep Something was bothering me So I tossed and turned for about three hours then I finally cant take it anymore I stood up and went straight to my room where shes sleeping I approached the bed gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me She stirred and woke up She asked whats up I told her you know the first time I saw you I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video She said you know what Ive been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer So we opened that drawer and lo and behold theres my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it,positive,TV,positive

"When I was a kid we had a neighbor who moved away and was so irresponsible as to abandon five pregnant female cats We took them all in and they all delivered their litters within the same week We blocked off the largest room in the house and turned it over to the kittens for the most adorable chaos ever Our house was mostly an open plan house so we didnt have a door on the wide entrance to the den which was the largest room and instead blocked it off with a closet door that was taken off its hinges and laid on its side across the portal Well one particularly adventurous kitten whom I called Patches because he was white with gray spots learned how to get over that door and then taught the rest of them the trick So we got a sheet of plywood that was taller than the door had been wide They got over that So we got a new sheet of plywood that was so tall we had to cut a door into it like at an ice hockey rink and they still got over it Finally we topped it with plexiglass cementing the appearance of this room to a hockey rink and they couldnt get over that But they tried

Patches was also the first to learn how to climb the curtains First he got halfway and then mewed until someone got him down Then he got all the way to the top of the curtain rod and mewed to be set down Then he walked to the other side of the curtain rod and mewed to be set down Then the most worrying thing happened he stopped mewing because hed discovered the secret of how to slide down the curtains with his claws out One day I came into the den and saw him leading a line of six other kittens across the curtain rod all of them to end their journey the same way by shredding the curtains We kept them for six months until they could be weaned had them all neutered and given a checkout and then gave all but six away from approximately two dozen after personally interviewing each prospect Then we got rid of the curtains the carpet and replaced all the furniture It was horrendously timeconsuming and expensive but Im proud of my parents for not just leaving the pregnant cats or turning them over to a shelter",neutral,TV,neutral

Hi as a bird person I just want to clarify most birds dont pair for life Some parrots and birds of prey do  penguins certainly do not despite the well known documentary  they may choose the same mate for a few years but then they may not Male birds are male and will essentially mate with anything that lets it and females will mate with the male with the flashiest plumage beautiful song or best nest The exception is in situations where teamwork is essential like birds of prey who have vast territories  in those situations they are monogamous Love your work Simon,neutral,TV,neutral

"I had a wonderful cat Miss Kitty was his name I was 6 years old and the name stuck Behaviorally he acted like a female he would clean up after his brother Fat Cat when he refused to cover his waste in the litter box 

Glaring at Fat Cat the whole time as if saying You are nasty and many other weird mannerisms that reenforced the thinking that secretly Miss Kitty believed he was a girl

That cat slept on the same bed as me and pillow from the day I got him I had a lot of nightmares and he helped keep them away

I know Miss Kitty loved me as much as I loved him Sadly I dont think I will find another pet and friend as awesome as Miss Kitty 

Im 24 now and to my sorrow Miss Kitty passed away on the night before Thanksgiving last year I stay with him until he was gone He had gone blind earlier that night but he had already been deaf for a few years

"If anyones interested in how claw machines are rigged heres some interesting factoids
Claw machines are designed to slowly grab tighter over a certain number of goes So say its set to a 30go cycle after 30 goes the claw will grab as tight as it ever grabs and this is usually when people win After that it will slowly get weaker before getting stronger again on another 30go cycle So if you can watch people play a claw machine for long enough you should be able to work out how long the cycle is based on when people win and then you can work out the best times to play to win

Or you could actually enjoy your life and just play it straight away and if you dont win you dont win",positive,TV,positive

seriously irritating that everyone keep calling IT a remake its a faithful adaption of Kings Novel,negative,TV,negative
The whole reason the original trailer wasnt scary is because back in the day they didnt give away so much crap that you know whats going on They left people wondering so theyd watch to find out whats happening Now we know darned near everything about a movie before its ever released so they have to hype up the scarycreepy because otherwise theres not much there but of course with this its a remake so it doesnt matter its all about effects,neutral,TV,neutral
